# Hyprlandporn dotfiles

This is daily driver desktop configuration files for my Arch Linux system. I currently use EndeavourOS, which is based on Arch Linux. The desktop environment was KDE Plasma and installed Hyprland along with it.

I used a pre-configured setup from [ml4w (Stephan Raabe)](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/) and mostly from [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit/) :D
